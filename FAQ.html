                <strong class="q">Q: What kinds of household pets are common around the world?</strong>
                <br>
                <p class="a">
                <strong>A:</strong>
                Not all people own dogs and cats. While many Europeans, including the British, French, and Italians, own dogs and cats, other people have different relationships to them. In Islamic tradition, dogs are shunned as unclean and dangerous, and thus it has never been common for people in the Muslim world to own pets. However, in Saudi Arabia and Egypt it has become fashionable among the upper class to own dogs and cats. (As early as 3500 BCE, Egyptians domesticated wildcats from Africa, which became their treasured pets and honored for their skill in hunting snakes, rats, and mice.) In China, cats are thought to bring good luck and are kept in shops and homes; the country also has about 150 million pet dogs—about one for every nine people. People in Japan keep birds and crickets as pets. Some indigenous peoples of Canada adopt bear cubs, foxes, birds, and baby seals. And Australian Aboriginal peoples sometimes capture dingo (wild dog) puppies and raise them for a time before letting them go.

                <br>
                <p class="a">
                <strong>A:</strong>
                People who own rats and mice may be shocked when they see their pet rodent has red tears and nasal secretions. Red crusts may also develop around their eyes and nose, and the forepaws may be red from rubbing the face. This redness is not caused by blood, but by the secretion of a red pigment called porphyrin. This pigment is released from a gland behind the eye called the Harderian gland. (The scientific name for the colored tears is chromodacryorrhea.) Although the red coloration is not blood, the red tears suggest your pet rodent may be ill because they cry these tears when they are sick or stressed.

                <br>
                <p class="a">
                <strong>A:</strong>
                Rodents—hamsters, rats, mice, gerbils, and guinea pigs—are very popular pets. Common to these pets is large front teeth, called incisors, which grow continuously throughout the pet's life. Overgrown incisors are a common problem and can be prevented by allowing the pet to chew on pieces of wood chewing sticks. Often a veterinary surgeon (a pet doctor) can trim these front teeth. Rodents are herbivorous (plant-eating) animals, and the digestive tract is, in some ways, similar to that of other planteaters, such as horsesand cattle. They love to use their front teeth to nibble and chew!</p>

                <br>
                <p class="a">
                <strong>A:</strong>
                No. The turtle’s outer shell is made of a thin layer of keratin, like your fingernails. But underneath that layer, there is a layer of bony plates that give the shell its shape. The turtle’s ribs and vertebrae (backbones) are part of the shell, too. Removing the shell would remove part of the skeleton of the turtle—which is why it is impossible for a turtle to remove its shell.

                <p class="a">
                <strong>A:</strong>
                Turtles and other reptiles, such as snakes and lizards, can carry salmonella bacteria. Although this does not affect the animal's health, it can make humans very sick. In order to avoid getting salmonella, a few rules of hygiene should be followed. Most important, don't put reptiles in your mouth. Wash your hands carefully with soap and hot water after you handle a turtle. Very young children should just look, and not touch, reptiles. Don't let reptiles walk (or slither) around in the house—keep them in their cages and tanks.

                <strong>A:</strong>
                No! Dogs should NEVER be given raw or cooked animal bones for several reasons. Raw bones run the risk of transmitting harmful bacteria, including Salmonella or Campylobacter, both to your dog and any...

                <br>
