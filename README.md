This is the repository for the project of ISYS2110 Analysis and Design of Web Info Systems, in Semester 1, 2022.


# Project Case

You are asked to design a web system for an animal hotel, BestMate Paradise, which allows people to make booking for their pets to stay in the "hotel" while thier owners are away or unable to look after them for a short while (a maximum of 28 days).
The site should provide information for the types of acceptable animals, "room" configuration for each type of animals, "food" menu, special facilities (outside space, "gym", pool), prices, insurance cover, galley etc.

## Business needs

To help and support clients to find a suitable and affordable accommodation for their pets, as well as allow them to make a booking of accommodation with details of the animal "resident".

# Marking Scheme

|Mark Range|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|40 to 55 pts|The system has excellent quality and information relevant to the purpose of the website. The pages are related to the functional requirements and business needs. The system has pages on About us (student names, unikeys and roles), Contact us information, Helpdesk/FAQ, Privacy policy, Site map, registration and login page, plus <span style="color: red">at least **TWO** 2 level of successful hierarchical navigation</span> (related to the submitted use cases). The system is obiviously using HCI theory in the design with good error trapping and reporting. It is aesthetics pleasing has sufficient white space with good page layout, and proper use of fonts. The system uses appropriate level of communication style for the target audience.|
