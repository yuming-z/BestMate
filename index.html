                        This was my first time using a pet hotel and I was initially very worried about the life of my two dogs at the property. But after seeing the helpfulness of the staff and the fact that the other pets in the hostel were taken care of, I was relieved a lot. It was a great pleasure to come back and see my dogs, and I think it's worth recommending this hostel to friends in need.

                        Leave my cat in Bestmate for a weekend. My cat had a great time there! The staff showed a lot of love, care and affection for my cat. I also noticed that my cat learned to behave better after a short stay in Bestmate. I will definitely use Bestmate's services again in the future.

                        I often have to work outside for a while because of my work, and Bestmate has always been a pet hotel I trust. My dog Saki got along very well with the staff there and was simply his second home! Thanks to Bestmate for making my life easier!
